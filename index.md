# William Mainaâ€™s portfolio

I am a computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2027.
## Favorite CPSC 120L labs. 

* Lab 3:
This was a fun lab because when I did the lab, I got a better understanding on how to declare a variable and how to initialize it. 
* Lab 5:
I enjoyed this lab because I finally learned how to calculate areas in programming and how to set up the formulas. 
*Lab 10:
I enjoyed this lab because I got to learn and understand how to code using loops.
